# variables and literals in Python.
# Python Variables
# In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data. For example,

number = 10
# Here, number is a variable storing the value 10.
print(number)

# As we can see from the above example, we use the assignment operator = to assign a value to a variable.
# assign value to site_name variable
site_name = 'learn_python'

print(site_name)
# Output: learn_python

'''Python Numeric Literals
Numeric Literals are immutable (unchangeable). 
Numeric literals can belong to 3 different numerical types: 
Integer, Float, and Complex.

1. Integer Literals
Integer literals are numbers without decimal parts. 
It also consists of negative numbers. For example, 5, -11, 0, 12, etc.

2. Floating-Point Literals
Floating-point literals are numbers that contain decimal parts.

Just like integers, floating-point numbers can also be both positive and negative. 
For example, 2.5, 6.76, 0.0, -9.45, etc.

3. Complex Literals
Complex literals are numbers that represent complex numbers.
Here, numerals are in the form a + bj, where a is real and b is imaginary. 
For example, 6+9j, 2+3j.'''

#Python String Literals
'''In Python, texts wrapped inside quotation marks are called string literals..

"This is a string."
We can also use single quotes to create strings.

'This is also a string.'
