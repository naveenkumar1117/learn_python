'''Python is a versatile, high-level programming language that
   is widely supported across all major operating systems.
   Now, let's write a simple Python program.
   The following program displays Hello, World! on the screen.'''

print("hello world")

'''In Python, anything inside print() is displayed on the screen.
   There are two things to note about print():
   1. Everything we want to display on the screen is included inside the parentheses ().
   2. The text we want to print is placed within double quotes " ", single quotes ' ' can also be used.
